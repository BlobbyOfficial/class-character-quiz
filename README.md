## 🚀 About

This is a fun, dumb quiz where every answer you pick leads you down a different path of questions. After 8-10 questions, you get a final result revealing your “classmate character” — from the Quiet Kid to the Drama Clown, and all the weirdness in between.

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this quiz works entirely in your browser with no backend needed.
